=======================================================================

This code is being released under the WTFPL; do what you'd like with it. That said, I'd -appreciate it- if you A) toss me some credit (readme or whatever), and B) kept this software free of charge.

Generic disclaimer: If the program doesn't work, kicks your dog, sends covert hit squads after your mother, or otherwise does anything you think is bad, I'm not responsible. I'm happy to help and implement suggestions, but at the end of the day the source-code is included and I am only providing you with this script with the hope it will make your life easier; I hold no liability toward its usage nor results.

Thanks, and enjoy.
